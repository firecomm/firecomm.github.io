If you are familiar with Express, think of the server-side call as you would a request in a middleware controller. \\n\\nFor all methods receiving an inbound call, the Firecomm server will look to that method's middleware stack, as defined in [`Server.addService()`](https://firecomm.github.io/docs/core/server). Firecomm takes the original call object produced by the gRPC library and wraps it with more consistent syntax and some extra methods.\\n\\n```javascript\\n\\n```\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
