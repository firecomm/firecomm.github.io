Server-Side Calls\n   - Passed as the sole argument into each middleware function / method handler\n#### 2. Stub-Side Calls\n  - Returned from invoking a gRPC method on a stub\n\nFirecomm has a unified syntax which makes each of these easy to interact with.\n\n## Server Calls\n\n## Stub Calls\n\n\n# Call Types\n\n> NOTE: There are eight types of calls in the gRPC ecosystem. \n\nBelow are the four main gRPC method types. \n\n|                      | Client Unary        | Client Streaming    |\n| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Server Unary**     | UnaryCall           | ClientStreamingCall |\n| **Server Streaming** | ServerStreamingCall | DuplexCall          |\n\nBut while there are four types of methods here, there are actually two variations of calls to accompany each method in the quadrant.\n1.
